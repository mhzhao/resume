This is an tweaked version of [AltaCV](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) for my own use.

- chnage all the icons to fontawesome5

- the Monaco font is from macOS, if you are not using macOS, change whatever font your system has in the `mhcv.cls` file

- can compile by any of pdflatex, latex, xelatex lualatex, the pdflatex will use different fonts from others
